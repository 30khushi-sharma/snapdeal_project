Scatter Plot is the best visual to show how discount varies with price range.

A scatter plot allows us to:
1.See whether higher prices tend to receive higher or lower discounts
2.Detect clusters, outliers, and trends
3.Add a trend line to show correlation
4.Spot non-linear patterns

Why the other charts are NOT ideal
--Histogram--
Used for one variable, not relationships.
It shows distribution of prices or discounts individually, not their relationship.

--Line Chart--
Used for time-series or ordered sequences.
Price is not a “sequence”, so using a line is misleading and visually incorrect.

--Heatmap--
Works best when you have two categorical / binned variables or matrix data.
For continuous vs continuous, you would need to bin both variables first
